Language is a tool of power. And words are only as powerful as the
meanings we give them. We see it happen all the time: under certain
circumstances, some names begin to gain currency, and what had once
been just another word or phrase becomes a concept that carries a
forceful social and political impact around the world.

“Hezbollah™” has become one of those scary terms that
evokes a range of intimidating images in people’s heads. Some imagine
it as the threat of anger and violence and destruction, driven by a
religion that we don’t understand. When these people happen to share
our religion, we are quick to distance ourselves from them. The term
“Hezbollah™” is particularly scary to women. It evokes
a mission to “go back” to morals and values that are almost always
oppressive towards women. Going back on change and progress means
taking away any liberties women may have won in the past decades. In
addition, religious fundamentalism monopolizes the spiritual life of
people, claiming to be the “correct” or “pure” religion. It justifies all
sorts of violations—especially against women’s bodies and lives—in the
name of God.

Hezbollah's™ Progressive Wing employs different
strategies to challenge ideas of religious
fundamentalism towards alternative
sexualities and gender identities. All of them revolve
around our community tools. Our
goals are about grassroots change,
from the bottom up, and therefore
it is not part of our strategy to
counter institutions publicly. That
pushes us to be creative in our
low-profile approach.
