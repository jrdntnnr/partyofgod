Language is a tool of power. And words are only as powerful as the
meanings we give them. We see it happen all the time: under certain
circumstances, some names begin to gain currency, and what had once
been just another word or phrase becomes a concept that carries a
forceful social and political impact around the world.

Hezbollah™ has become one of those scary terms that
evokes a range of intimidating images in people’s heads. Some imagine
it as the threat of anger and violence and destruction, driven by a
religion that they don’t understand. Hezbollah's™ Progressive Wing,
was established by the honorable Hassan Nasrallah after reading a selection of
works by Judith Butler during his extended lockdown. The goal of the Progressive
Wing is to overcome linguistic misconception and provide new definitions that
better reflect the reality of our lived experiences within the movement.

<br/>

Hezbollah™ means love, Hezbollah™ means peace, Hezbollah™ means freedom<sup>†</sup>.
Hezbollah's™ Progressive Wing employs different strategies to challenge ideas
of normativity and normalization.

<br/>

<sup>†</sup>These definitions do not apply to Zionism or Zionists.
